## Text Mining with Python
### Neal Caren (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill)

This book is an introduction to collecting and analyzing "big data" for social scientists. Over the last decade, the variety and types of data available to researchers have exploded, including not only contemporary data, such as from websites and social media platforms but also historical data, from digitized interviews to 19th-century newspapers. At the same time, analytic techniques from computer science are increasingly being used to solve social science problems.
One volume is not enough to master the techniques for collecting and analyzing big data. This text will, however,  establish the foundation for developing these skills. The book is designed as a practical overview. The emphasis each chapter will be on applying the specific techniques rather than on their mathematical basis. Combined, readers will have the skills and resources to use these methods to theoretically-relevant problems in the social sciences.

This repository includes the Python materials for the book as Jupyter notebooks. To use the text interactively:
 * Follow the [link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nealcaren/tmwp/master) to run all the notebooks interactively.
