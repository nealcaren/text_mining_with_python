# Setup

Before attending the workshop you should set up a scientific Python computing environment using the [Anaconda python distribution by Continuum Analytics](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). This page describes how. If this doesn't work, let [me](mailto:neal.caren@gmail.com) know and I will set you up with a virtual environment you can use on my server.




## Why Python?
As is true in human language, there are hundreds of computer programming languages. While each has its own merit, the major languages for scientific computing are C, C++, R, MATLAB, Python, Java, and Fortran. MATLAB and Python are similar in syntax and typically read as if they were written in plain english. This makes both languages useful tools for teaching, but they are also very powerful languages actively used in real-life research. MATLAB is proprietary while Python is open source. A benefit of being open source is that anyone can write and release Python packages. There are many wonderful community-driven packages available to scientists, including NumPy, SciPy, scikit-image, and Pandas.


## Installing Python 3.7 with Anaconda

There are several scientific Python distributions available for MacOS, Windows, and Linux. The  most popular, [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda), is specifically designed for scientific computing and data science work. For this course, we will use the Anaconda Python 3.7 distribution. To install the correct version, follow the instructions below.
1. Navigate to the [Anaconda download page](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and download the Python 3.7 graphical installer.
2. Launch the installer and follow the onscreen instructions.
3. Congratulations! You now have the beginnings of a scientific Python distribution.
